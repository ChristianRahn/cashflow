cashflow
========

Disclaimer: If you're looking, yea it's a mess. This project is halted pending a few factors.

Cashflow is designed to be a visualization of the transfer of assets between multiple parties, over time. 

The viz layout will be: individuals represented as shapes (fluid/particle), with resources flowing between all mapped individuals and in/out of the system (boundary TBD).
